# Streetwear-Web

## Concept
An online destination for streetwear enthusiasts, offering wide range of products presented in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.

## Features
- **Cart Functionality**: The code manages the shopping cart functionality, allowing users to add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and view/update the cart.
It listens for click events on buttons related to adding items to the cart (add-to-cart buttons), incrementing (plus) and decrementing (minus) quantities, and closing the cart tab.
Quantity adjustments and additions to the cart trigger functions that update the cart's total price, including any applicable discounts based on the total price range.

- **Toggle Navbar Functionality**: Toggles the navbar visibility when the menu button is clicked. This enhances user experience by providing a responsive navigation menu.

- **Redirect to Profile Page**: Listens for clicks on the user icon button and redirects users to the profile page. This feature enhances user interaction by providing name, email and passwords.

- **Redirect to Review Page**: Listens for clicks on the review button and redirects users to the review page. This feature allows users to move the slider, changing amount of star rating and adding comment in the feedback box.
